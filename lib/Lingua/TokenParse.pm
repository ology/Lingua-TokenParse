=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lingua::TokenParse;
  my $p = Lingua::TokenParse->new(
    word => 'antidisthoughtlessfulneodeoxyribonucleicfoo',
    lexicon => {
        a    => 'not',
        anti => 'opposite',
        di   => 'two',
        dis  => 'separation',
        eo   => 'hmmmmm',  # etc.
    },
    constraints => [ qr/eo(?:\.|$)/ ], # no parts ending in eo allowed
  );
  print Data::Dumper($p->knowns);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module has been DEPRECATED in favor of L<Lingua::Word::Parser>.

This class represents a Lingua::TokenParse object and contains
methods to parse a given word into familiar combinations based
on a lexicon of known word parts.  This lexicon is a simple
I<fragment =E<gt> definition> list.

Words like "automobile" and "deoxyribonucleic" are composed of
different roots, prefixes, suffixes, etc.  With a lexicon of known
fragments, a word can be partitioned into a list of its (possibly
overlapping) known and unknown fragment combinations.

These combinations can be given a score, which represents a measure of
word familiarity.  This measure is a set of ratios of known to unknown
fragments and letters.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  $p = Lingua::TokenParse->new(
      verbose => 0,
      word => $word,
      lexicon => \%lexicon,
      lexicon_file => $lexicon_file,
      constraints => \@constraints,
  );

Return a new Lingua::TokenParse object.

This method will automatically call the partition methods (detailed
below) if a word and lexicon are provided.

The C<word> can be any string, however, you will want to make sure that
it does not include the same characters you use for the C<separator>,
C<not_defined> and C<unknown> strings (described below).

The C<lexicon> must be a hash reference with word fragments as keys and
definitions as their respective values.

=head2 parse

  $p->parse;
  $p->parse($string);

This method clears the partition lists and then calls all the
individual parsing methods that are detailed below.  If a string
is provided the object's C<word> attribute is reset to that, first.

=head2 build_parts

  $parts = $p->build_parts;

Construct an array reference of the word partitions.

=head2 build_definitions

  $known_definitions = $p->build_definitions;

Construct a table of the definitions of the word parts.

=head2 build_combinations

  $combos = $p->build_combinations;

Compute the array reference of all possible word part combinations.

=head2 build_knowns

  $raw_knowns = $p->build_knowns;

Compute the familiar word part combinations.

This method handles word parts containing prefix and suffix hyphens,
which encode information about what is a syntactically illegal word
combination, which can be used to score (or even throw out bogus
combinations).

=head2 lexicon_cache

  $p->lexicon_cache;
  $p->lexicon_cache( $lexicon_file );
  $p->lexicon_cache( lexicon_file => $lexicon_file );

Backup and retrieve the hash reference of token entries.

If this method is called with no arguments, the object's
C<lexicon_file> is used.  If the method is called with a single
argument, the object's C<lexicon_file> attribute is temporarily
overridden.  If the method is called with two arguments and the first
is the string "lexicon_file" then that attribute is set before
proceeding.

=head1 CONVENIENCE METHOD

=head2 output_knowns

  @known_list = $p->output_knowns;
  print Dumper \@known_list;

  # Look at the "even friendlier output."
  print scalar $p->output_knowns(
      separator   => $separator,
      not_defined => $not_defined,
      unknown     => $unknown,
  );

This method returns the familiar word part combinations in a couple
"human accessible" formats.  Each have familiarity scores rounded to
two decimals and fragment definitions shown in a readable layout

=over 4

=item separator

The the string used between fragment definitions.  Default is a plus
symbol surrounded by single spaces: ' + '.

=item not_defined

Indicates a known fragment that has no definition.  Default is a
single period: '.'.

=item unknown

Indicates an unknown fragment.  The default is the question mark: '?'.

=back

=head1 ACCESSORS

=head2 word

  $p->word($word);
  $word = $p->word;

The actual word to partition which can be any string.

=head2 lexicon

  $p->lexicon(%lexicon);
  $p->lexicon(\%lexicon);
  $lexicon = $p->lexicon;

The lexicon is a hash reference with word fragments as keys and
definitions their respective values.  It can be set with either a
hash or a hash reference.

=head2 parts

  $parts = $p->parts;

The computed array reference of all possible word partitions.

=head2 combinations

  $combinations = $p->combinations;

The computed array reference of all possible word part combinations.

=head2 knowns

  $knowns = $p->knowns;

The computed hash reference of known (non-zero scored) combinations
with their familiarity values.

=head2 definitions

  $definitions = $p->definitions;

The hash reference of the definitions provided for each fragment of
the combinations with the values of unknown fragments set to undef.

=head2 constraints

  $constraints = $p->constraints;
  $p->constraints(\@regexps);

An optional, user defined array reference of regular expressions to
apply when constructing the list of parts and combinations.  This
acts as a negative pruning device, meaning that if a match is
successful, the entry is excluded from the list.

=head2 verbose

Boolean

=head1 EXAMPLES

Example code can be found in the distribution C<eg/> directory.

=head1 TO DO

Turn the lame C<output_knowns> method into a sensible XML serializer
(of optionally everything).

Compute the time required for a given parse.

Make a method to add definitions for unknown fragments and call it...
C<learn()>.

Use traditional stemming to trim down the common knowns and see if
the score is the same...

Synthesize a term list based on a thesaurus of word-part definitions.
That is, go in reverse.  Non-trivial!
